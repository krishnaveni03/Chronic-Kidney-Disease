# Chronic Kidney Disease Prediction

## Overview

This project is a web-based application that predicts the likelihood of Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) in individuals based on various medical attributes. The application is built using Python and Flask and utilizes a Machine Learning model for predictions. Users can input their medical data, and the application will provide a prediction of whether they are at risk for CKD.


**Chronic Kidney Disease Prediction Deployment**

Repository: Chronic Kidney Disease Prediction
Description:

Utilizes a machine learning model trained on medical data to predict CKD likelihood.
Facilitates early detection and personalized intervention for improved patient care.
Allows users to input medical information for prediction and provides insights for healthcare professionals.
## Features

- User-friendly web interface.
- Prediction of CKD based on medical data.
- Visualization of prediction results.
- Integration of a trained Machine Learning model.

## Prerequisites

Before running the application, ensure you have the following:

- Python (3.7 or higher) installed.
- Required Python packages (flask, scikit-learn, pandas, etc.) installed. You can install them using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
- Trained Machine Learning model for CKD prediction.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/krishnaveni03/Chronic-Kidney-Disease.git
   cd Chronic-Kidney-Disease
   ```

2. Run the Flask application:

   ```shell
   python app.py
   ```

3. Access the application in your web browser at `http://localhost:5000`.

## Usage

1. Open the web application in your browser.

2. Input your medical data, including attributes like blood glucose, blood urea, pedal edema, and more.

3. Click the "Predict" button to receive a CKD prediction.

4. The application will display whether you are at risk for CKD or not, along with an appropriate message.

5. You can also navigate to the "HOME" button to return to the main page.
